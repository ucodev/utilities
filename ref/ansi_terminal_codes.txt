E[nT    Scroll display n lines down (reverse)


E[nm    Set character attributes:
        n =  0 normal attribute (all off)
        n =  1 bold
        n =  4 underscore
        n =  5 blink
        n =  7 reverse
        n = 3X set foreground color
        n = 4X set background color

        X = 0 black    X = 1 red
        X = 2 green    X = 3 brown

        You can set more than one thing by separating them with a
        semi-colon. eg.  E[0;1;33;40m

E[s     Save cursor position

E[u     Restore saved cursor position

E means 0X1B

if n is 0 then it can also be left off
E[0J  ==  E[J
