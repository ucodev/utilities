  - See INSTALL file

+ Usage:

  - Install uperft
  - See the examples/ directory for more details regarding module development
  - Use the tu/ directory as your first uperft test:

    # uperft tu/ -20 1000000000 /tmp/results.csv

  - The above command will execute all the unit test modules in the tu/ directory with a nice level of -20 and will store
    the results into the /tmp/results.csv file. The 1000000000 value defines how many times the perft_run() function
    will be called (i.e, the number of iterations for this benchmark). The following is a typical output of
    /tmp/results.csv:


	Unit Name;Iterations;Avg. Time (usec);Total Time (msec);Errors
	SAL Unit;1000000000;0.004340;4340.000000;0
	MUL Unit;1000000000;0.004420;4420.000000;0
	ADD Unit;1000000000;0.005780;5780.000000;0
